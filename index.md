I am a graduate student in the Software Engineering Department, Xi'an Jiaotong University, advised by Prof Jinjun Wang.
I was a research intern at the BaseDetection group of Megvii(Face++), focusing on object detection and instance segmentation, mentored by [Zeming Li](http://www.zemingli.com/).
My research mainly focus on object detection and instance segmentation.
